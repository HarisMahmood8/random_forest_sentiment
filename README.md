The code consists of two Python scripts, "sentiment.py" and "predict_sentiment.py," which work together to perform sentiment analysis on text data. In "sentiment.py," the first script, it loads a CSV file named "test.csv" containing text data and their corresponding sentiment labels. It then preprocesses the text data by removing stopwords and tokenizing the text, encodes the sentiment labels, and splits the data into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split. The text data is converted into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization, and a Random Forest classifier is trained on the training set. The model's accuracy and classification report are printed, and the trained model is saved to a file named "sentiment_model.pkl" using the joblib library.

In "predict_sentiment.py," the second script, you can load the pre-trained model from "sentiment_model.pkl" and use it to predict sentiment on new text data. Specifically, you can input text, such as the contents of "equifax_cc.docx," and apply the pre-processing steps to the text (removing stopwords and tokenizing). Then, you can use the loaded model to predict the sentiment (positive or negative) of the provided text. This script enables you to leverage the trained model to perform sentiment analysis on different text inputs without the need to retrain the model each time, making the process efficient and reusable.
